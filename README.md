## Summary:

The people who buy in the stock market are investing with the thought that they are at some advantage, leading to an eventual profit. The biggest advantage in that industry comes from information, which is why insider trading would be so profitable if it weren't illegal. The biggest source of general, public information is the news. People use the news to make educated guesses about what stocks are worth trading. However, the news is such a massive outlet of information that nobody can process all of it well enough to make accurate predictions about the stock market.

That is why we've decided to train a neural network stock market predictor using news headlines as inputs. Our vision is that the neural network's computational power will allow it to process a large chunk of news headlines to create an estimate for the differential in the stock market.

## Future:

While the main source of data for many people is the news, our current era of mass communication introduces another: social media. We hope to expand to include sources like Twitter as factors of the stock market predictor.
